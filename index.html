    <h2>What is vegan diet?</h2>

    <p>
      A vegan diet contains only plants (such as vegetables, grains, nuts and
      fruits) and foods made from plants. Vegans do not eat foods that come from
      animals, including dairy products and eggs.

        <ul>
          <li>2 cups oats</li>
          <li>1 cup almonds</li>
          <li>2 tbsp unsweetend coco powder</li>
          <li>20 pitted dates (soak them in water for a few hours)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Blend almonds and scoop out 1/3 on a large plate.</li>
          <li>
            Add oats and coco powder to your blender and blend it all into a
            fine flour like consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drain the dates and add them to the blender. Blend with slow speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoop out a little bit of the mixture and make small balls which you
            can roll in the almond powder you previously left aside on a plate.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          That is it! Now you can leave them on the plate and store in the
          fridge for days.
